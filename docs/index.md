# ChaosCore (name subject to change)

## What ChaosCore? 

The goal of ChaosCore is **not** to develop an Out-of-Order Core that meets some baseline functionality. Instead, the goal(s) of this project are the following:
* To create an Out-Of-Order Core generator that provides performance enhancing configurability
    * Cache replacement techniques, pre-fetchers, etc... We refer to these as "widgets"
* Demonstrate security as a key trade-off with these often information leaking enhancements
    * Address security through the generation of mitigations 
* To provide a core designed with verification as a "first class" concern

Make above more concise

I can word this as a core designed optimized for 3 primary considerations Performance, Security, and Verification.
Maybe include a triangle diagram thing

ChaosCore is the first core generator designed with security configuration built in. It is also the first public core verified under the UVM?
(UVM verification doesnt make verification any better though, really)
